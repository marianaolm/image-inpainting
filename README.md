# Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper **"Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting"**. The goal of the algorithm is to remove large objects from digital images and fill the resulting hole in a visually plausible way by combining techniques from **texture synthesis** and **inpainting**.
